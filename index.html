       <p>Life finds a way. I was part of something special. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. <b></b> I was part of something special. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.<b></b>

Must go faster. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Life finds a way. Forget the fat lady! <b></b> You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?<b></b>

Must go faster. Must go faster. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. <b></b> Must go faster. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.<b></b>

Goodbye! <b></b> Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.<b></b>
