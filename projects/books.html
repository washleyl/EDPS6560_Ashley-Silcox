            <h2>Jumanji</h2>
              <h3>by Chris Van Allsburg</h3>
	        <p>Chris Van Allsburg’s exciting tale of a children’s board game coming to life will intrigue and captivate readers of all ages. Young Judy and Peter are left at home with strict instructions to “keep the house neat”, but after a quick venture to the park across the street and the discovery of the mysterious jungle board game Jumanji, these instructions from their parents soon become impossible. While the first few moves from each player bring slightly more compact and simple disturbances (such a lion in the bedroom and rain in the living room), with each roll comes more and more bizarre oddities (including a rhino stampede through the house and a volcano eruption!). Although Peter would like to clean up these messes practically (“Can’t we just call the zoo and have him taken away?”), Judy reminds him of the most important of the game’s rules: “Once a game of Jumanji is started it will not be over until one player reaches the golden city.” But will this happen?
	<br>Van Allsburg’s detailed and distinctive drawings bring realism to the fantastical events of the jungle game Jumanji. With each player’s role and the occurrence of more extravagant events, the drawings become more blurred between reality and fantasy. Each page includes just enough features to draw the reader into each experience, but leave just enough out that the reader is able to add their own imagination. Readers will remain on the edge of their seats until the game’s competition, where they will feel the relief and fatigue of Judy and Peter, and wonder if this is a game they will ever want to experience themselves.</p>

	    <h2>That is My Dream!</h2> 
	      <h3>by Langston Hughes</h3>
                <p>That is My Dream is an energizing and raw depiction of a young black boy’s dream of equality. We follow him as he ventures through town with his mother and sister, sitting in the back of the bus, using segregated water fountains, and visiting segregated stores. Then, the “rest at cool evening” in the park with his family brings peace, and he is able to dream in the dark of the night, “dark like me.” We see his desire to be free; to drink, play, and rest with friends (regardless of their race) through his powerful expression of a brighter, more inclusive world. <br>
   Daniel Miyares’ rich use of paint adds to the sincerity and genuine nature of the poem. Each thick and detailed brush stroke brings a sense of realness to the characters. The stark white of day adds tension and strain felt between the black and white characters, while softer tones bleed through as evening falls tonight, “dark like me.” Then, gentle hues follow as the boy sees his dream. The reader can feel the peace he feels, and his hope that someday this dream may become a reality. </p>

             <h2>Can I Touch Your Hair? Poems of Race, Mistakes, and Friendship</h2> 
               <h3>by Irene Latham and Charles Waters</h3>
                 <p>This powerful and realistic collection of poems gives readers a straightforward view of some ideas, perceptions, and realities of race through the eyes of two young children. Authors Irene Latham and Charles Waters weave together the stories of Irene, a white girl, and Charles, a black boy. They are assigned to write poetry together, and while their teacher encourages them to “Write about anything! It’s not black and white”, Irene tells the reader, “But it is. Charles is black, and I’m white”. While the characters write poems about hair, family, and activities they enjoy, the reader is also taken on a journey of fear, misconception, varying paradigms, insecurities, self-discovery, acceptance, and understanding. <br>
 Sean Qualls and Selina Alko use paint and colored pencil to weave together a beautiful yet simple visual display that helps the reader connect with Irene and Charles. The use of thin lines and blank white spaces gives a sense of calm amongst the strong and confusing emotions the children experience and share, while the texture of the print on a dress or shirt, or collaged words in the sky add a level of depth to each page, and give a more realistic feel. Intermittent pages of background color convey more intense views, which allows the reader to connect more with the characters. This beautiful collection of poetry communicates differing experiences in a relatable and safe way.</p>

	     <h2>Knock, Knock: My Dad's Dream for Me</h2>
	       <h3>by Daniel Beaty</h3>
                 <p>In Knock Knock, a loving relationship between father and son is shown through a simple game of “knock, knock”. However, one morning, his father does not knock. The reader follows the boy throughout his days while he waits to hear the knock from his father, feels his confusion when his father’s knock does not come. The boy writes a letter to his father; “Papa, come home, ‘cause I miss you, miss you waking me in the mornings and telling me you love me.” How can he learn the things he needs to as he grows older, without his father?  One day, he receives a letter from his father, answering some of his son’s questions. “Knock, Knock with the knowledge that you are my son and you have a bright, beautiful future. For despite my absence you are still here.” Daniel Beaty eloquently shares a story of a father who is incarcerated, and how his son learns to cope with this separation. <br>
Bryan Collier uses bold and varying textures which brings a realistic quality and draws the reader’s eye across each page, which is extended beyond the book. The story begins with controlled illustration, but becomes more chaotic as the boy’s father leaves, and doesn’t come back. The boy grows older and his expanded understanding is reflected in the compilation of chaos and control. The main character is introduced bigger and with soft lines, but becomes smaller with the absence of his father, until he grows again as he finds himself.

	     <h2>The Bell Rang</h2> 
	       <h3>by James E. Ransome</h3>
                 <p>The bell rings, signaling the beginning of another laborious day. A young girl, a slave, and her family rise with “no sun in the sky” to a bell ringing each day. The start of each day filled with grueling work in the fields. But, also the start of a new day with a loving family, who finds small comforts in each other. Each day begins the same, until one day, when older brother Ben whispers “goodbye”. The next day, instead of waking to the sound of the bell, “I wake to the sound of Mama and Daddy searching, looking...Ben ran.” The reader follows this family through the pain and anger of a beloved family member who chose to leave. But, can they accept and rejoice that he is now free? <br>
James E. Ransome’s use of acrylics brings an authentic and genuine representation of the characters and circumstances of the story. Bright colors interspersed throughout bring feelings of hope, while darker tones convey the despair the family feels. Thick brushstrokes bring a sense of stability in the routine of each day and draws the reader’s eye across the page, and through the book. Readers of any age will become immersed in the poetic language and sincere account of this family and their desire for freedom. </p>

	      <h2>Eye Spy: Wild Ways Animals See the World</h2>
	        <h3>by Guillaume Duprat</h3>
                <p>Guillaume Duprat truly captivates readers with his nonfiction picturebook Eye Spy: Wild Ways Animals See the World. By first explaining how humans see the world and how the human eye work, Duprat then takes readers on a journey as they learn about how various animals of all types (mammals, birds, reptiles and more!) view the world. While chimpanzees see “almost like us”, cows can see almost 360 degrees, and bees can see in ultraviolet! Each animal presented is more distinct than the last, and each is accompanied by detailed and research-based facts about their eyesight. <br>
Duprat’s use of soft lines and neutral colors gives the reader a sense of ease and calm, while the eye flaps add depth and texture to the story and draws the reader in. Each flap displays additional facts about that animal’s eyesight abilities, as well as a realistic scene so the reader can experience what the animal sees.  Added details, such as ultraviolet color and “mosaic vision”, when applicable, enhances the experience. Through this experience, the reader gains an awareness of the similarities and differences of each animal and how they view the world. This beautifully, yet subtlely illustrated picturebook is sure to engage and educate readers of all ages. </p>
