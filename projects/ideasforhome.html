               <p>What can you do with my child at home to help support their reading development and progress? Below are some ideas!</p>
	     </div>
	


		<ul>
			<li>Read with your child! Allow them to ask questions, and ask questions as you are reading. As they engage in reading, they will become interested.</li>
			<li>As your child plays, interact with them, and incorporate literary elements! Can they help with a shopping list? Want to play restuarant, where they can take your order?</li>
			<li>Take them to the library. There they can have access to additional texts, and participate in additional literacy activities (such as reading challenges!)</li>
		</ul>
